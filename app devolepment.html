                       <p>Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources. </p>
                      
        
                     
                      <p>Traditional desktop and laptop PCs are Windows-based with a standard screen size, features and form factor. The mobile landscape is much more fragmented, with four main platforms (Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry) that are continually evolving.</p>
                    </div>
                 </div>
                 <p>Accordingly, building mobile applications requires more factors to consider when planning, including which device platform to build first, what mobile technology option to choose, what capabilities should the mobile phone support, and the need for a long-term roadmap with deployment on additional, next platforms. In contrast to traditional Windows-based desktop development, mobile developers need to think about creating application code for multiple platforms-Android, Windows Phone, iPhone and BlackBerry. Designing an application that is optimized for various devices with different screen densities and screen sizes is even more challenging Applications designed for a desktop or laptop client work with a screen size that far exceeds that of mobile devices. How to design for a device that fits in your pocket requires simplification and a rethink about navigation. While a desktop application may have tabs, options and links on all sides of the screen and in-line with text, for mobile you need to concentrate on the immediate function, reducing the number of options to only those needed for the immediate task or feature. </p>
                <p>Devices available from different manufacturers vary from 120 dpi for the lower-end HTC Tattoo / Wildfire and 240 dpi for the higher end Droid series—a difference of 100% in screen density. This means that using hardcoded values for pixels and a single set of images will lead to one of two things on a higher end phone: either your UI will be up-scaled and fuzzy, or the controls will be too small to allow comfortable targeting with a finger. Therefore you need to bundle multiple resolution images and use display metrics to scale your custom drawing code.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Multichannel and Multimodial UIs</h2>
                <br>
                <p>We have thus far discussed user interfaces in some detail. We have seen that, depending on the function of the mobile application, we may want to interact with the user through audio, a traditional GUI, or a combination thereof. We have also seen that, because of the wide variety of capabilities among mobile devices and the proliferation of the platforms, there are a great number of user interfaces that we may have to implement for a given application. Although we have looked at mobile GUIs and then VUIs individually, we have not looked at the discipline of building applications that may use more than one channel of communication with the network or interact with the user through more than one mode of their user interface. This is what we will be discussing in this chapter. let us define what multichannel and multimodal mean for these two terms have been incorrectly used widely in the literature on mobile computing. To start, remember that multimodal and multichannel are not the same thing. Multichannel may have two different meetings. First, it can be used to imply a user interface that establishes more than one communication channel to the user. For example, a user interface may present an audio and a video channel to the user.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Intents and Services</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background. It does not provide a user interface. Once started, a service might continue running for some time, even after the user switches to another application. Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.</p>
              
                <p>Types of services</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Foreground</li>
                  <li>Background</li>
                  <li>Bound</li>
                  <li>Intent Services</li>
                </ul>

                
                <br>
                <h2>Characteristics of Mobile Applications</h2>
                <br>
                <h5>Connectivity:</h5>
              
                <p>The device is continuously logged into mobile network as the apps are constantly online. In this way users particular information and notifications being pressed to app as they are accessible. This is an important characteristic of mobile application to be available anywhere. Otherwise actively called service to get reaction is worthless in mobile environment. The ability of push becomes essential in growing apps on every Smartphone as this characteristic keep the app in user minds.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Localization:</h5>
               
                <p>Localize info and the opportunity to provide position based information is critical feature that craft mobility stunning and practical. It works like elimination of chaff from the wheat, thus embeds the app according to user context. The feature may not be perfect for every apps but it a good thinking to associate location with note or photo and limiting possible options and/or sorting places. The feature beautifully adds good user experience.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Convenience:</h5>
               
                <p>A simple and emotional design guarantees high value and acceptance among users. The overall usability and information structure must be planned carefully to build a joyful and fit interaction flow. Surely a good content is a plus point while analyzing user requirements and crafting useful idea out of this is also essential.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Approachable:</h5>
              
                <p>Approachability covers additional trait provided by the mobile apps nature. An excellent application can really be used any time at any place as reach ability becomes full time availability. This feature is in the sense of up to date information and usefulness. Think of time aware options and relevant content round the clock.
                    Individualization or Personalization is 
                    Creating individualized content based on personalized context or usage is another feature. Everyone wish that my application should fit my needs and behave like what I want to do. This specific feature not only covers personalized content but wants to control over shared and store data for more actions.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Security:</h5>
                
                <p>There are several aspects of security like transferred data over network via carrier network. Some applications sync data with online, web apps, so the storage of the information on server must be secure. Another critical security breach can be the mobile device itself as I do not want anybody to play with my mobile phone.
                    These may be general features and characteristics but play vital role in the mobile applications. Almost every software service provider offer the application development services but only few mature companies seriously care about these characteristics and features to give ultimate mobile app to end user.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <h2>Storing and retrieving data</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Synchronization and Replication of Mobile Data</h5>
                    <p>The word repetition means "produce your own copy" and comes from the Latin word replicates. The term synchronize is defined by the Webster dictionary as “to represent or organize (events) to indicate coherence or co-existence.” Synchronizing and duplicating two important functions on a distributed computer. While synchronization may mean different things, duplication is used to refer to data. Like the literal meanings of synchronization and repetition in the English language, their definitions in computer field are different but related. In this chapter, we will limit our discussion of synchronization and duplication in data synchronization and data duplication. As you may already have noticed, we have used the word sync, in Chapter 8, when we synchronize content with actions that are transmitted to multiple channels. We discuss synchronization in the context of data duplication Data duplication, in its broadest sense, simply refers to copying data from one or more data storage locations to another or to other data storage locations. Note that these areas are visible areas and not visible areas - physical areas do not have to be in different areas of the body. The tax on the types of replication technologies depends on the problem of the domain and the infrastructure in which it is repeated. However, we can divide almost all data duplicates into two </p>

                  <br>
                  <h2>Communications Via Network and Web</h2>
                  <br>
                  <h5>State Machine</h5>
            
                  <p>Downloading data at the end. The program can have up to 3 regions: upload, success, and error. The state-of-the-art machine also has an original design, which means that here it is named "not started" but you can design whatever you want. Here, the first situation indicates that the API has not been called yet.</p>
                  <p>When the user unlocks the screen, the screen starts downloading data, so the world goes "loading". If the API call returns success / error, the state moves to SUCCESS / ERROR respectively. After that, when the user refreshes the screen, the state returns to LOADING. We can call the annotation "download", "error", "success", "update" event or input. The transformation function detects the current state and input and determines the next world.
                    Any meaningful plan always has negative consequences. These side effects are the result of changes from state A to B. For example, when the state changes from NOT_STARTED to event download downloads, the program displays a progress bar on the screen and downloads certain data to the server.
                    Let's get in with the code. First, we define the provinces (when drawing a diagram you should also start by describing the provinces). ERROR and SUCCESS conditions have a loaded lead. We also use a closed section to ensure that all provinces are in one place.
                    sealed class ApiState  
                  </p>
                  <p> The transformation function also confirms the event. For example, if the current status is NOT AWARD, then the call to success () would not change anything. Often you may want to do something when the current situation changes from A to B, called side effects. In the code above, I set out the call to call again at StateChanged which will be recruited after the change of province.
                    Finally below is an example of a network application on screen. When the country is DOWNLOADING, data will be downloaded and the upload idea will be displayed. The fetchData function will call the success () or error () based on the API call result.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Wireless Connectivity and Mobile Apps</h2>
                    <p>Technology users and consumers are working with more devices than ever before. Using a smartphone, you can sync a smartwatch, buy a point of sale, control your home alarm, or call a drone. Depending on the device, you may use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, or mobile data networks to connect to these devices.

                      As an engineer, you may want to create programs for a specific device, or perhaps upgrade your connected device that can be controlled via a smartphone. Before you uninstall your IDE and start using the hardware, let's take a quick look at Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC and mobile data to learn how this technology works, and which apps are best suited.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h5>
                        NFC
                      </h5>
                      <p>Near Field Communication (NFC) defines a set of protocols that enable two adjacent devices (up to 10 cm apart) to communicate. Like many other proximity card technologies, it uses electromagnetic input where two devices exchange information at a frequency of 13.56MHz. One device can be a weak NFC tag rather than a label or poster, meaning that the reader can simultaneously start reading data and enable tags. Data rates are typically between 106-424 kbit / s. NFC supports three different methods:
                        Card simulation allows the device to function as a smart card. (Actually, this is the method used by Apple Pay and Android Pay. Read / Write mode enables the device to read and write information on NFC tags. Peer mode facilitates the exchange of information between devices in an ad-hoc format. NFC has a variety of programs operating systems, but late payment payment solutions have been the best available for Android and iOS devices. In general, NFC is best suited for applications that require close proximity between the phone and a tag or device and is currently secure, only a limited set of devices that support -NFC. Compatible iOS devices for iPhone 6 / 6S / 6 + / 6S + and AppleWatch. Apple has not yet opened access to the development of these sensors via the API, so it is being used by Apple Pay. -Android offers an API for development, but also, there are not many Android phones on the market including NFC support, especially not for low prices.

                        <h5>Bluetooth</h5>
                        <p>Bluetooth was conceived as a short-term data exchange agreement. It uses the same frequency range as 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi but has 79 channels (less than 4.0 versions), and 40 4.0 and more channels. However, unlike most Wi-Fi applications, it uses a technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum that constantly changes the channel to avoid congestion caused by competing networks. Data entry rates are also very high, from Bluetooth 1 Mbit / s 1.2 to 24 Mbit / s of 4.0 and above. All iOS and many Android devices support Bluetooth. Some standard Bluetooth applications include wireless headsets and data entry as a modem.</p>
                       <br>
                        <h5>Bluetooth LE</h5>
                        <p>Bluetooth LE (Low Power) is a subset of Bluetooth 4.0 data designed for low power applications. It has a maximum data rate of 0.27 Mbit / s and a power consumption of less than 0.01 W, up to 0.5 W (about half of what a standard Bluetooth device uses.) To put this in perspective: Most powerful smartphone batteries start from at 1400-3000 mAh (milliampere hours) but strives for a day or two of battery life, but it is not uncommon for a 100 LEA-based Bluetooth LE tracking device to last longer for a week or more. Apps that use Bluetooth LE include dynamic trackers, smartwatches, and multiple medical devices.The LE stack contains a few predefined generalized number (GATT) numbers that define communication methods for a variety of devices such as heart rate monitors, pressure gauges. blood vessels, or proximity sensors. This means that if a company was using a tool to track data, it would not need portable software to retrieve data from it.
                          While not as widely available as standard Bluetooth support, Bluetooth LE device support, however, is excellent. All over 4S iPhone models support it, as well as the iPad 3rd generation or newer. On the Android side, things are even more complicated, because the launch of the support that first appeared on Android 4.3 was slow and limited to intermediate mode (meaning communication is blocked on some Bluetooth LE devices) but the phone can't act as a borderline. Android4.4 has provided stable performance, and Android 5.0 has added support for traffic-related advertising. By default, any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 also supports Bluetooth LE, including older mobile phones such as the Galaxy Nexus and other recent releases in the Nexus range, as well as tablets like the Nexus 7 2013 and newer models. These days, even the most inexpensive Android phones such as the LG Lucky, which sells for about $ 10, also offer Bluetooth 4.0 support

                          <h2>Security</h2>
                          <p>Application security defines security measures at the application level that aim to prevent data or code within the application from being stolen or hijacked. Includes security considerations that occur during application development and build-up, but include systems and ways to protect applications after they have been implemented.
                            Application security may include hardware, software, and processes that identify or minimize security risks. A router that prevents anyone from viewing a computer's IP address on the Internet is a secure application for hardware. But security measures at the application level are also generally built into the software, such as an app firewall that strictly defines what activities are allowed and restricted. Procedures may include things like application security protocols that include protocols such as standard tests. System security is the process of creating, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security threats from threats such as unauthorized access and modification.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Why app security is important?</h5>
                            <p>Application security is important because modern applications are often available on various networks and are connected to the cloud, increasing the risk of security threats and breaches. There is increasing pressure and incentive not only to ensure security at the network level but also between applications itself. One reason for this is that hackers are tracking apps with their attacks today more than ever before. Application security tests can reveal vulnerabilities at the application level, helping to prevent these attacks. Developers can also encrypt applications in applications to reduce security risks.</p>
                   
                            <h5>Authentication: </h5><p>When software developers create processes in an app to ensure that only authorized users have access to it. Authentication procedures ensure that the user is what they claim to be. This can be achieved by requiring the user to provide a username and password when logging in to the application. Multiple authentication requires more than one form of authentication - features can include something you know (password), something you own (mobile), and something you are (thumbprint or face recognition).</p>
                            <br>
                           
                           <h5>Authorization:</h5><p>After the user is verified, the user can be authorized to access and use the application. The system can verify that the user has permission to access the app by comparing the user's identity with the authorized user list. Authentication must take place before authorization so that the app can only match verified user credentials in the authorized user list.</p>
                           <br> 
                           <h5>Encryption: </h5><p>After the user has verified and used the app, some security measures can prevent sensitive data from being seen or used by the cybercriminal. For cloud-based applications, where traffic containing sensitive data travels between the end user and the cloud, that traffic can be encrypted to keep data safe.</p>
                           <br>
                           <h5>Logging: </h5><p>If there is a security breach in the application, signing in can help identify who accessed the data and how. App log files provide a timed record of which app features were accessed and by whom.</p>
                           <br>
                           <h5>Application security in the cloud</h5><p>App security in the cloud brings additional challenges. Because cloud environments provide shared resources, special care should be taken to ensure that users have access to only the data they are authorized to view in their cloud-based applications. Sensitive data is also a major threat to cloud-based applications because that data is transmitted over the Internet from user to app and background.</p>
                           <br>
                           <h5>Mobile application security</h5><p>Mobile devices also transmit and retrieve information across the Internet, in contrast to the private network, making it vulnerable to attack. Businesses can use virtual private networks (VPNs) to add a layer of mobile app security for employees accessing remote apps. IT departments may also decide to test mobile applications and ensure that they comply with company security policies before allowing employees to use them on mobile devices that connect to the company's network.</p>
                           <br>
                           <h5>What are application security controls? </h5>
                            <p>Application security controls are strategies that enhance the security of the application at the coding level, making it less vulnerable to threats. Many of these controls deal with how the app responds to unexpected inputs that a cybercriminal can use to exploit vulnerabilities. The programmer can write the program code in such a way that the developer can better control the effect of this unexpected input. Fuzzing is a type of app security test where developers test the results of unexpected prices or inputs to find out what makes the system work in an unexpected way that could open a security hole.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Testing</h2>
                            <p>Performing a comprehensive quality assurance (QA) during the mobile app development process makes the applications stable, usable and secure. To ensure a complete QA test for your application, you must first prepare test cases that address all aspects of the app testing.
                              Similar to how the trial cases run the mobile app development process, test cases run the mobile app test. Test cases are designed to perform test steps, record software quality test results, and correct retrieval follow-up. Best practice puts your QA team in the Analysis and Design stages. Familiarizing yourself with the performance requirements and objectives of your app will help generate accurate test cases.
                              Your app should have the following test methods, to deliver a quality flow solution.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>User Experience Testing</h5>
                              <p>A critical step in mobile app testing is to make sure that the final implementation matches the user experience created by the app build team. The visuals, workflow, and interaction of your app are what will give your users a real view of your app. Make sure your app uses compatible fonts, style treatments, color scheme, data folding, thumbnail layout and navigation. Ensuring that your app complies with the original design guidelines will have a direct impact on its user adoption!</p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>Functional Testing</h5>
                              <p>The accuracy of your mobile app performance is critical to its effectiveness. It is difficult to predict the behavior of the end user and the usage situation. Your app's performance should be tested by multiple users to cover as many possible test scenarios as possible. You may be surprised to catch bugs when two different users test the same feature but get different results. For example, both users can fill out the same form, but both can enter different data - which can lead to the acquisition of a feature. The purpose of performance testing is to ensure that users can use the features and functionality of your app without any problems. It can be categorized according to system testing (application is fully functional), and unit testing (per function performance app) If you are building an iOS and Android mobile platform app, then your performance test should include feature comparisons between both versions of your mobile app.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>Security Tests</h5>
                              <p>Security is a major concern for business mobile applications. Any potential risk can lead to intrusion. Many companies hire outside agencies to conduct a thorough evaluation of their applications. Your QA and development teams can take a few simple steps to make your app secure.If your app requires users to sign in, these logs should be tracked on the device and in the backend. User times should be terminated by a system where the user stays idle for an extended period of time (ten minutes personally or less in the mobile app). If your app stores user information on a device to make it easier for them to sign in again, you'll need to make sure you're using a trusted app. For example, the iOS Apps development platform provides a Keychain feature that can be used to store user account information for a specific app.Data input forms within your mobile app should be checked to ensure there is no data leakage.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>Device and Platform Testing</h5>
                              <p>On average, new mobile devices enter the market every 12 months with new hardware, firmware, and design. Mobile applications are updated every few months. Many hardware manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola use the Android platform, but they customize the platform for their mobile devices (because Android is an open source). Devices come in different sizes and sizes Compare that with Apple, which has a much more controlled environment, because it controls Hardware and OS. However, there are many iPhone and iPad (Apple iOS) devices on the market, where testing during the mobile app development process differs significantly from web application testing. You can escape by checking your web application in the Chrome browser instead of Windows. But your mobile app should be tested on most mobile devices or device simulators to ensure the best performance of your app for all users.Mobile application testing on all mobile devices, ongoing support costs, and mobile device headaches are the main reasons why companies are so common to create business applications for a single mobile platform (and often provide mobile devices to their users). In our experience, many companies tend to improve their initial business plan with Apple's mobile platform; only where they need to build an Android platform app.Testing is important for the future success of the app; includes a large part of our entire mobile app development process. Having a complete cell phone testing strategy is a must for bringing a high-quality mobile app. During the testing phase, there are many ways to spread your app development to testers. The most common method for iOS apps uses Testflight and Android apps via email or via the Over The Air (OTA) installation.</p>
